Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS"). We will focus on FaaS.

The best known vendor host is currently [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). AWS Lambda is excelent service and I advise you to try it. Here, we will focus on open source solutions with the possibility of a private-cloud infrastructure instalation.

Important attributes of serverless are:

 - No management of server hosts or processes
 - Self auto provision & auto-scale based on load
 - Costs based on actual, precise, usage
 

## OpenWhisk

Apache OpenWhisk is a serverless, open source cloud platform that executes functions in response to events at any scale. Browse the [documentation](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk) for more information.
